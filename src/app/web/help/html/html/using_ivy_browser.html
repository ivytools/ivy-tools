    If you fired up the program, you should see the following: <BR>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/11-mainframe.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">

<P>
The first time you run the app, you need to set the location of the Ivy repository or repositories (yes, you can have more than one).  Click on the
    "Specify Repository" button:
<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/14-specifyRepository.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
   <P>
Enter a URL for your repository.  You can either select an existing value in the dropdown if needed, or type a new one, which will get added to the
    dropdown.<p>
    Once you've added your repository location, you don't need to change it, unless you switch repositories.  It will persist across invocations.
    <p>
Click the "OK" button to start parsing the repository.  This may take some time, depnding on the size of the repository and network speed.  It's multithreaded, so
    on a local network it really flies.  You'll see the spinner go as it parses entries, and the entries are listed on the status bar at the bottom:<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/16-parsingRepository.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
    <P>
    Once the respository has been parsed, it's contents are visible in the table.  Note the "Parse Repository on Open" checkbox - you'll probably want
    this checked so that the repository will parse as soon as the program opens if you've only got one repository.  If you have to switch often, you'll want to
    leave it unchecked so you won't parse a repository you aren't using.<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/17-repository.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
    <P>
As nice as this looks, it isn't very navigable.  Type some key words in the "Find library" textbox, like "commons lang"<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/18-filteredRepository.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
    <P>
Note that just the items with "commons" or "lang" are visible.  You can filter off of org, module, or revision.<P>
    Now the fun begins - click on a row (in this case, commons-lang 2.4) - you get a dialog showing you what's in Ivy, and all the jars that will be brought in:<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/19-commons-lang.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
    <P>
Clicking on the "OK" button closes the dialog, and you've now got that entire line of XML in your copy/paste buffer, ready to paste into your Ivy file!<P>
    Selecting the "Force this version" checkbox adds the "force=true" snippet:<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/20-forced.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
    <P>
But wait, there's more!<p>
    Let's select "hibernate 3.2.0", and see the dialog:<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/23-hibernateAll.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
    <P>
    We can now see all depencencies that Hibernate brings in, and there are there are a bunch of things we don't want in there -
    we only want one cache implementation.  We just have to unselect the checkbox for the ones we don't want, and the XML will reflect that:<br>
    <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/24-hibernateFiltered.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
    <P>
    But wait, there's still more!<p>
        <i>Right</i> click on the line for swarmcache, and another dialog comes up for it, so you can see what it brings in:<br>
        <IMG SRC="../assets/images/browser/26-drillDown.png"  BORDER=1 ALT="">
        <P>
        <P>
        <P>

    Wasn't that easy?
