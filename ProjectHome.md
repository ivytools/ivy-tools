These are a collection of tools for managing and searching your Ivy 1 or 2 repository.  There are GUI tools for:
  * Searching an Ivy repository for libraries, packages, and versions by key words - automatically pastes the needed line for your ivy.xml file
  * Adding items to the Ivy repository - prepare the directory, add the jar files, input the dependencies, generate the XML, and generate the checksums.
  * Create graphical reports of your project's Ivy dependencies.
  * Format your project's Ivy files nicely (also works for Ant and general XML)
  * Finding out what the Java versions are of the libraries used in your projects.  Avoid the dreaded "class file has wrong version 49.0, should be 48.0" errors!  Not really an Ivy program, but still very useful.

These are all functional and solid applications.  I'm making the source available so that others have access to it.  Want more features?  Become a contributor!

To run these programs (they're all Java Web Start apps), go to : http://ivy-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webstart/index.html.  Full documentation is also there so you can see exactly what they do before running them.
